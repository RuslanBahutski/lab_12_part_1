	<h1>The Cyber House Rules</h1>
<p>Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. I'll get my kit!</p>
<h2>The Prisoner of Benda</h2>
<p>Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! Goodbye, friends.  I never thought I'd die like this.  But I always really hoped. Bender, this is Fry's decision&hellip; and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit!</p>
<ul>
<li>THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!</li>
<li>Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.</li>
<li>Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it.</li>
<li>I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Duh-Vinci Code</h3>
<p>Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Oh God, what have I done? THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! Eeeee!  Now say "nuclear wessels"!</p>
<h4>Bendless Love</h4>
<p>I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. And I'm his friend Jesus. Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it.</p>
<ol>
<li>This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant!  Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!</li>
<li>Your best is an idiot!</li>
</ol>
<h5>Where No Fan Has Gone Before</h5>
<p>Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! Shut up and take my money! Moving along&hellip; No! The cat shelter's on to me. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat.</p>
